# Rubicon

A Godot project integrating a unification of rhythm game elements, characters, and levels!

This engine is designed to be robust and optimized while still keeping the development workflow as smooth as possible towards developers looking forward to using this engine.

This repository is a sample project for Rubicon users to get started, using assets from the hit indie game [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin).

# Status

This engine is in a very Work-In-Progress state at the moment, so not everything may be functional. The moment we feel like this engine is stable enough to be used in actual fan games is when we will remove the W.I.P and bump up the version to v1.0.

This engine is currently being reformed, so unless you know what you're doing, the engine isn't easily usable at the moment.

# Developing on Rubicon

If you're developing on Rubicon, whether it's contributing to the engine or making your own fan-game, you should be aware that the way this engine handles tasks is nothing like how most other Friday Night Funkin' engines handle them, if the switch to Godot wasn't enough of an indicator.

We plan to have a wiki to help developers better understand the engine more easily, so please bear with us! :pray:

## Obtaining Rubicon

We like to keep Rubicon short in dependencies, all you really need is [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org), preferably v4.5.1 but it will most likely work in similar versions.

After that, all you need to do is cloning this repository **recursively** as you'll need the submodules for the engine to work:
```
git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/RubiconTeam/rubicon_fnf
```

Although this repository is highly recommended to use Rubicon, its mostly a compilation of our engine's plugins. You can get the engine in its basic form by cloning the [Rubicon Addon](https://github.com/RubiconTeam/rubicon) and optionally but highly recommended, the [Mania Addon](https://github.com/RubiconTeam/rubicon_mania)

# Contributing

We would appreciate your guys' help so much! The main way to help us out would be to submit issues or pull requests. It would be a struggle if everyone split off to make their own version of Rubicon when we could all benefit from it!

Keep in mind that this repository is the sample project. For contributing to the actual code base itself, go to the [Rubicon addon repository](https://github.com/RubiconTeam/rubicon).
